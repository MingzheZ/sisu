Although Ben had been a project lead in the past, she felt he had no reason to question her technical abilities, especially just because she questioned his.   \"Why doesn't he trust my responses?\" she thought.  \"Maybe I'm not good enough to be project lead, or didn't explain well enough.

Her role is to configure the graphical user interface of an environmental information systems platform. The multimillion dollar project is headed by both her and her project lead, Bob, who has at least twenty years of experience in software consulting.  \r\n\r\nDuring meetings with their clients, Bob would frequently interrupt Maggie as she was presenting material and sharing her expertise. Specifically, he would contradict and diminish her technically-sound statements. At one point, Maggie observed an issue with data being displayed from a greenhouse gas emissions feature of the application. She attempted to alarm Bob, but, during a phone conversation where Maggie explained how she wanted to address the error, Bob responded impatiently, telling her the error was non-existent and sarcastically concluding:\" You obviously don't need me in this matter\" after which he abruptly hung up the phone.  Generally, Bob would dismiss any of Maggie's concerns, becoming upset when she independently escalated the issue to upper management. \r\n\r\nFrustrated, Maggie ruminated: \"Am I being treated this way because I'm a young woman? Am I being perceived as too vocal or a whiner?\" Maggie shared how she felt with her manager, Rick. \"I know Bob can be difficult, but he has a lot of experience so you should trust his leadership,\" Rick advised. Although unsatisfied with his answer, Maggie obliged with his recommendation.\r\n\r\nHowever, a few weeks later during a product delivery meeting, the customer pointed out the error Maggie had originally discovered. Questioning why the mistake was not caught earlier, Bob explained that \"it was too late; nothing can be changed now, \" and, afterwards, placed blame on Maggie for the mistake. \r\n \r\nFeeling hopeless, infuriated, and exasperated, Maggie felt she had nowhere to turn. \r\n\r\nWhat should she do?",

    "text": "Carissa is one of seven electrical engineering researchers at Marzi University's artificial intelligence lab. Carissa has been feeling increasingly conflicted in recent months; her relationship with one of her teammates, Sean, has been a major contributor to her frustrations.  Specifically, she had an increasing suspicion he had been trying to keep favorable project results to himself. For example, on multiple occasions, when Carissa requested critical experimental data, Sean would counter by asking: \"Why do you need it?\" Carissa was annoyed she always had to justify her requests, but things came to a head after she offered to perform a new technique Sean had taught her in order to achieve a mutual research milestone.\r\n\r\nAfter practicing the novel technique, Carissa presented her promising but imperfect results at her team's weekly research meeting. Soon after the meeting's conclusion, Sean sent an email to both Carissa and their research lead. Sean criticized Carissa's experimental results, stating: \"Carissa performed the experiment incorrectly. I tested the technique myself and managed to obtain perfect results! She should have incorporated another technique to get good results.\"\r\n\r\nCarissa could feel her ears burning. Feeling attacked, several thoughts flew across her mind: \"Aren't we supposed to be a team?  Why is he criticizing me for results I obtained using a technique he himself told me to use?  Secondly, why didn't he teach me the 'other' technique if he knew they would produce the correct results?\" Carissa was also irked because she did not know why Sean would copy their lead in the email message.\r\n\r\n How should Carissa handle this situation?",

    "text": "Avery is an aerospace engineering masters student at University of Bryne. As a National Science Foundation fellow, she was constantly in the lab doing research on rocket fuels, but, like many other students, preferred going out to experience new people and places. Oftentimes, when she and her other lab mates were together in the lab, she could not help but overhear them making plans--some spontaneous, such as trying out a new restaurant for lunch, and others less impulsive, such as going on a holiday-weekend camping trip. \r\n\r\nInterestingly, although her lab mates were of similar backgrounds (e.g. aerospace engineering majors performing research activities on rocket fuels), not once did they invite her to their many outings.  Avery could not help feeling excluded.\r\n\r\nOne day, Avery overheard them discussing plans and decided to speak up: \"You're going to the bar this weekend?\" Jonathan, one of her labmates, paused: \"I don't think it's really your scene.\"  Another researcher, Chris, averted his eyes, mumbling: \"We're not sure yet, we may end up not going after all.\" At that point, the rest of her lab mates decided to excuse themselves. \r\n\r\nAvery felt a sinking feeling in her stomach. \"What happened there?\" she thought. \"Oh I know--maybe it's because I'm a woman.\" \r\n\r\nWhat should Avery do?",

She was assigned to work under Mike, a senior staff engineer, who has been with the company for over 20 years. Additionally, one of her teammates, Lilly, has been with the firm for over 15 years and is team lead. Mallisia noticed some inefficiencies in a piece of Lilly's code, and wanted to introduce a design pattern to make the application more efficient.  \r\n\r\nMallisia shared her thoughts with Lilly and asked if implementing the particular design pattern would be doable. Lilly concurred, while also suggesting she obtain buy-in from Mike. As a result, Mallisia scheduled a meeting to discuss the idea with Mike and Eric, another project stakeholder. After describing her strategy, Mike immediately replied: \"That may not be practical as it would involve a lot of code changes. It will be especially difficult for Lilly--I don't think she understands the pattern you mentioned. Besides, she is very old-fashioned and will not accept new changes. The best thing to do is to keep the existing design.\" \r\n\r\nShocked at what she just heard albeit not comfortable enough to confront Mike in front of Eric, she could only muster a weak \"OK.\"  After the meeting, Mallisia felt sad: \"Although Lilly is project lead and has worked with Mike for many years, if he can say such inappropriate things about her behind her back, what has or would he say about me?\" \r\n\r\nWhat should Mallisia do as an observer?",

    "text": "Carly has been working as a civil engineer for the City of Newport's Traffic Division for about two years.  One day, she applied for a promotional position within the same organization which entailed undergoing two rounds of interviews.  When interview results were posted, Carly observed selected candidates were not chosen by rank.  Out of the fifteen candidates interviewed, Carly was the only female interviewee and ranked under top five.\r\n \r\nA month later, as the extended job offers were not claimed, the same position and opportunity to interview resurfaced. Carly decided to re-interview.  This time, although she was ranked number one, she heard rumors two other candidates were offered the position but declined the respective offers.\r\n\r\n A few months later, the position was reopened for applications.  Although the Division was short-staffed, Carly was frustrated she was not chosen, despite being highly-ranked twice and meeting all the position's key qualifications.\r\n\r\nHer colleagues advised the hiring manager \"did not like women engineers because they questioned him too much.\"  Recalling she was the last female engineer hired by the Division, Carly wanted to raise her suspicions to HR, but did not want to incur negative repercussions. \r\n \r\n\"If I were a guy, I would not have an issue with asking the manager what was wrong with my application.  But since I am a female engineer, I am fearful confronting him may cause me appear arrogant and condescending. \"\r\n \r\nHow should Carly proceed?",

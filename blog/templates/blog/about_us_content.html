        					<h2>About <br />Our Story</h2>
        					<p>One event. One school. Two passionate women engineers. </p>
                  <p>Our friendship started in the most conventional of ways; 
                  one was a student, other was her teaching assistant.  </p>
                  <p>After a few exchanged doodles via homework assignments on graphing paper, 
                  we finally met in-person at a Society of Women Engineers event being hosted at our university… </p>
                  <p>...and the rest was history. </p>

        					<h2>Why <br />Sisu</h2>
        					<p>Our logo represents our vision to shine (y)our light in any situation, no matter how difficult...even shining the smallest light is an opportunity to ultimately help other women 
Even though we cannot physically be there to help the inidividual, we hope the support from others would help him or her to face the situation in a positive way 
If you ever feel like you’re alone, you are most likely not, and we want to be your virtual light
We also feel that when we shine our light to you, we feel like you are helping us too :)
This website also helped us to not feel bored and practice coding!
We named our project Sisu because the name means ____ in finnish, which we felt was a perfect match for our goal

						Our friendship started in the most conventional of ways; one was a
						student, other was her teaching assistant.
						
						After a few exchanged doodles via homework assignments on graphing
						paper, we finally met in-person at a Society of Women Engineers event
						being hosted at our university...
						
						...and the rest was history.

		<h1>Our Mission</h1>
		<div class="about-us-lower-panel-block">
			<img src="{% static 'img/icon/handshake.svg' %}" alt="">
			<h4>We are not alone</h4>
			<p>Harassment, discrimination, politics, and other conflicts in the workplace
					inspired us to realize that many other women could be facing similar
					situations in their workplaces.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="about-us-lower-panel-block">
			<img src="{% static 'img/icon/heart.svg' %}" alt="">
			<h4>We want to listen</h4>
			<p>Interviewing and collecting cases from women who have undergone
					unfavorable incidents in academia or industry is our mission.
					We want to highlight the real, the here, and the now in the hopes of
					
					illuminating truth in the darkest places.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="about-us-lower-panel-block">
			<img src="{% static 'img/icon/handshake.svg' %}" alt="">
			<h4>We want to work with you</h4>
			<p>By bringing awareness to universities, corporations, and other organizational
					entities, our “Empower Now” program intends to prevent inappropriate
					incidents from occuring in the workplace. Inspiring empathy in every user is
					key to preparing them to respond aptly to on-the-field situations.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="about-us-lower-panel-block">
			<img src="{% static 'img/icon/comments.svg' %}" alt="">
			<h4>We want to speak up</h4>
			<p>Our published cases aim to empower women, particularly those in STEM fields, to
					speak up--whether it be to their perpetrator, manager, organizational authority, or
					themselves. We want to help women embrace their emotions, discern the best
					
					path forward, and, ultimately, heal from their incidents.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="about-us-lower-panel-block">
			<img src="{% static 'img/icon/chart-bar.svg' %}" alt="">
			<h4>We want you to stick with it</h4>
			<p>More than 200 women in top, tech firm positions reported sexist work interactions,
					with one in three women having felt afraid for their safety [1]. Additionally,, nearly 40
					percent who earn engineering degrees either quit or never enter the profession [2].
					Thus, our mission is simple: to help women joyfully pursue their STEM dreams without
					feeling uncomfortable, inhibited, or dissuaded in any way because of uncalled for
					people-play.
